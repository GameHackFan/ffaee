- Created a DefaultTextPatch.
- Added the DefaultTextPatch to the PatchMap.
- Forced DefaultTextPatch to be applied when generating a ROM if no other text patch was applied before.

<br/><br/>

Known Bugs:
- Enemy spawning sometimes bugs for some reason, I don't know why (probably overloaded?).
- Close to the end of the 2nd Level, enemies delay to spawn (I have no idea why).
- Close to the end of the 3rd Level, enemies delay to spawn (maybe it is because of the boss?).
- Molotov enemies behave weirdly sometimes.
