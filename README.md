<br/><br/>

Known Bugs:
- If Haggar grabs Axl or Slash and the other player hits them in a frame they will block, they will get stuck in air for a few seconds, they also might fall on top of barrels (bug present in the original game).
- Roxy and Poison sometimes get stuck in a crouch animation and they can't be hit (bug present in the original game).
- It is possible to kill the last boss (Belger) before he goes to the corner, which leads to a bugged animation of him falling through the window (bug present in the original game).

NOTE: The CPS2 version of FFAE is already released, so I will leave this tool editing the CPS1 version and I will probably create a new project that will be a clone of this one and I will make the changes needed so it can edit the CPS2 version. Even thought I will keep the CPS1 editor live, it is very unlikely that I will make any updates to it, updates will be released only for the CPS2 editor.
