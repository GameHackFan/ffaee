Known Bugs:
- Close to the end of the 3rd Level, enemies delay to spawn (maybe it is because of the boss?).
- If one player grabs HollyWood, El Gado or Rolento when they are one hit to die and the other player kills them using the Special Attack, they become immortal. You can unbug them if you die once and immediately goes for a grab, you can't hit them not even a single time. (bug present in the original game).
- If Haggar grabs Axl or Slash and the other player hits them in a frame they will block, they will
get stuck in air for a few seconds, they also might fall on top of barrels (bug present in the original game).
- Roxy and Poison sometimes get stuck in a crouch animation and they can't be hit (bug present in the original game).
- It is possible to kill the last boss (Belger) before he goes to the corner, which leads to a bugged animation of him falling through the window (bug present in the original game).
- P1 after dying all lives can't select the same character P2 is using (FFAE bug).
- Haggar dynamite scene is being drawn bugged (FFAE bug).
