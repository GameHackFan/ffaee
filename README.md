# FFAEE - Final Fight Anniversary Edition Editor (Arcade)
An editor for the game Final Fight Anniversary Edition (Arcade).
<br/><br/>

You can access the editor [here](https://gamehackfan.github.io/ffaee/).

Version 0.5 Changes:
- Created EnemySpawnImprovementPatch. It removes a validation that was bugging the enemy spawning.
- Added EnemySpawnImprovementPatch to the PatchMap.
- Forced Level Editor and Randomizer to apply EnemySpawnImprovementPatch patch.
- Changed F. Andore's pallete to Simons's pallete (He was actually using P3's pallete that was haggar's by default but it could change to Guy's or Cody's leading to a bugged pallete).
- Minor changes.
- Minor fixes.

Known Bugs:
- Close to the end of the 2nd Level, enemies delay to spawn (I have no idea why).
- Close to the end of the 3rd Level, enemies delay to spawn (maybe it is because of the boss?).
- Molotov enemies behave weirdly sometimes.
- If one player grabs HollyWood, El Gado or Rolento when they are on hit to die and the other player kills them using the Special Attack, they become immortal (bug present in the original game).
- If Haggar grabs Axl or Slash and the other player hits them in a frame they will block, they will
get stuck in air for a few seconds, they also might fall on top of barrels (bug present in the original game).
- Roxy and Poison sometimes get stuck in a crouch animation and they can't be hit (bug present in the original game).
- It is possible to kill the last boss (Belger) with haggar before he goes to the corner, which leads to a bugged animation of him falling through the window (bug present in the original game).
