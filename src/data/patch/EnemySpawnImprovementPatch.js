// Enemies spawning are limited to 1F (31), so if more than
// that spawns, it would lead for more than half of the enemy
// types to stop spawning (Andore, Girl and Axl type are exceptions),
// when enemies dies, the counter also drops by 1, which sometimes
// could result in 0 being subtracted by 1 resulting in FF (255),
// which is checked as an unsigned value by the validation.
// Since this counter and validation fews more like a limitation,
// better to just remove it.
